Roadmap:
	[ ] finish started work
	[ ] check all contained configuration files
	[ ] get some communication going, motivate others to join
	[ ] extend automated testsuite
	[ ] add embedded servers for:
		[ ] SMB
	[ ] get code coverage > 70% -> Alpha release
	[ ] get code coverage > 80% -> Beta Release
	[ ] fix all bugs along the way
	[ ] re-add the installer (windows/linux/(mac?))
		[ ] Windows X86_64
		[ ] Linux DEB
		[ ] Mac
	[ ] windows/linux/(mac?) shortcuts
		[ ] Mac?
	[ ] improve sync speed
	[ ] ask for mac testers
	[ ] --> Stable Release
	[ ] move all images, xml's, config files into the fullsync jar, into some resource package to make loading them easier
		[ ] images
		[ ] config files
		[ ] split fullsync.jar into fullsync.jar and fullsync-ui.jar, where the fullsync.jar should work standalone without GUI dependencies
	[ ] exception handling: look up ways to minimize exception handling code, should also allow to specify that we don't want to handle them and just rethrow them (debugging)
		[ ] move most Exceptions to RuntimeExceptions?
	[ ] review & improve documentation of the commandline arguments

Roadmap 0.11.0:
	[ ] restore handling of buffering = syncfiles (search for [BUFFERING])
	[ ] make sure everything is translatable
	[ ] make shortcuts configurable

Bugs:
	[ ] Exception if starting sync on a readonly FS
	[ ] if folder creation fails on a ro FS the task is being marked as succeeded
	[ ] Update Task Count based on decisions made(correct?), 1337 of 7331; 42 incoming, .. outgoing
	[ ] Profile can be stored without vital data (src, destination, name)
	[ ] the buttons in the main list view need tooltips
	[ ] the task decision dialog should not show ./ at the start either / or nothing at all(2)
	[ ] task decision dialog Action, Size columns are too narrow
	[ ] task decision dialog needs a lot of love
	[ ] dialogs must initialize themself fully without relying on change/* events being dispatched
		there are some dialogs that rely on change events of other controls to fully initialize,
		the profile dialog however has proven that SWT does not behave identical on eg windows and linux,
		thus any such dialog might fail on either platform
	[ ] FullSync launchers need to be able to accept arbitrary JVM arguments (debugging, RAM, ...)
	[ ] sockets are treated like directories, and listing their children results in an exception
	[ ] SMB: does Ntlm authentication with domain accounts work with FullSync?
	[ ] Hidden files do not remain as Hidden after folder synchronization
	[ ] Information loss when synchronizing txt files. Summary is missing in destination folder
	[ ] No Warning message appears after changing the path of destination or source folder
	[ ] Fix missing error handling in net.sourceforge.fullsync.buffer.BlockBuffer.storeBytes(InputStream, long)

Features:
	[ ] TaskDecisionDialog:
		* Ignore all Incoming
		* Ignore all Outgoing
	[ ] detect file renames:
		* have a source buffer with file metadata (and hash?) (git-annex?)
		* if a new file has the same metadata that a file has that is missing it's most likely the same file but renamed
	[ ] Exact Copy: allow users to specify that they want to remove deleted files before transferring new files (needed in case the destination is low on free space)
	[ ] Watch for changes, automatically handle changed files (probably allow to specify that the file should not have changed for x seconds before it's synced)
	[ ] Profile groups: allow to group profiles together, sync multiple profiles with a single click.
	[ ] Portable edition: provide a download for a pre configured portable version of FullSync
	[ ] execute uploads and downloads in parallel


Future:
	[ ] fix net.sourceforge.fullsync.TaskGeneratorImpl and net.sourceforge.fullsync.Synchronizer (multithreading)
